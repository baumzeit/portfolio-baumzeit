The game adds one note to the sequence that is played back to the player after successfully reproducing the previous one gradually increasing the speed. The game ends after round 20 rewarding the victorious player with a visual feedback and a short and nice winning melody that I came up with.\nBuilt with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and a little sound library."
